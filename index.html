<b>Internet Basics</b>

<br>
 HTML is the "glue" that holds it all together.
 <br>
 HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
 <br>
 Information is transfered from a sever to your desktop via HTTP, which is Hper Text Transfer Protocol.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Tags</b>
 <br>
 We learned about two types of tags. inline and block.
 <br>
 Examples of inline include; <b>Bold</b>, <em>Emphais</em> and <a>Anchor</a>.
 <br>

 <p>Examples of block include; Paragraph and Division</p>

 Anchor tags are for adding <a href="www.bestpizzastone.com">Links</a>.
 <br>
 <br>
 Image tags are also for adding <img src="http://i.imgur.com/fdGeWES.png" alt="Ooops"</a> images.
 <br>
 <br>

 Image tags and break tags are examples of "void" tags. (i.e tags with no closing brackets).
 <br>
 <br>
 <p> We learned about dealing with "white space" through either the break tag or the paragraph tag.</p>
 <br>

<b>HTML Documents</b>
